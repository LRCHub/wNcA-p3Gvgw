There ya go, thinking you' re so cool
But your words don't mean that much at all.
You stretch what's meant by 'friend'
I only know its got to end
Cuz in the morning you'll feel different
There was a time i wished you didn't
Now you're just a waste of space
And thats nothing now
There ya go, squatting by the wall
And your words don't make much sense at all.
There's no point in your talk
You better concentrate on where you walk.
